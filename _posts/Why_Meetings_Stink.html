Anyone who has ever worked with me knows that I dislike lots of meetings. There
are two primary reasons I dislike lots of meetings, the first is just the way my
brain works and the second is an indication of a much bigger issue.  I'm not
unique in my dislike of meetings.  And the fact is I don't dislike all meetings.
</p>

<p>
I dislike meetings that:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Are not necessary.</li>
<li>Are not part of a normal process.</li>
<li>A replacement for someone doing their job.</li>
<li>Unproductive.</li>
<li>Invite everyone "Just in case".</li>
<li>Most importantly, miss-managed.</li>
</ol>

<p>
During my career I have seen frequent cases of all of the above.  In my
experience, controlling the number of meetings and amount of time spent in
meetings is the easiest way to reduce engineering overhead.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgd61684d" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgd61684d">Meetings cost money and take away from an engineers primary job.</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgd61684d">
<p>
First, when I walk by a conference room full of people my brain will instantly
(almost) count the number of people in the room and multiply that by the time
they have been there and an average hourly rate for my employees.  Effectively I
calculate what that meeting is costing while I'm walking by.  They next
question that follows is "I wonder if that meeting is really worth X dollars".
</p>

<p>
A quick example, let's say I walk by and see 8 of my engineers sitting in a room
with product management.  They have been there roughly an hour and my average
hourly rate (fully loaded) is 70.00.  That meeting is costing 560.00/hr.  On top
of that cost I have also lost an hour of productivity! (assuming this meeting is
not part of the normal development process)

<div id="outline-container-orge47aebf" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orge47aebf">Meetings are not a replacement for process.</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge47aebf">
<p>
Second, if I see this occurring frequently I can only assume there is a hole in
the process somewhere.  With a well oiled process there is no good reason for
that many developers to be meeting with product management frequently.

<div id="outline-container-orgf4a148d" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgf4a148d">What too do when you smell a 'stink'?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf4a148d">
<p>
Like anything you need to develop metrics to determine if there is a real issue.
There are a couple of ways you can tackle this issue.  Honestly, I recommend
both as they are both important metrics for an engineering team.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orga1093d6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orga1093d6">Engineers need to track time</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga1093d6">
<p>
I know this is 'un-popular' and I intend to write another blog about the
importance of time tracking in the future.  Put simply, engineers need to track
time spent on "planned" engineering work.  This is relatively simple to do with
most tools available today.  Using this information you can calculate your
engineering overhead.  Overhead being all time spent on un-planned or activities 
un-related too engineering (e-mail, chat, meetings, etc&#x2026;).  If your overhead 
is 20% or less that's probably all you need to know. Of course if this changes 
over time you need to understand why.

<div id="outline-container-org1b1ff4e" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org1b1ff4e">Look at your teams calendars</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org1b1ff4e">
<p>
   As a manager I have access to all of my direct/in-direct reports calendars 
(you should too). A weekly or monthly review is another indicator of if there 
is a problem or not.  You could go so far as developing a script which
calculates your teams total time spent in meetings (by department) if you like.
Honestly this is the most accurate way too determine how much time your team 
(individually and collectively) is spending with whom.

<div id="outline-container-org287389e" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org287389e">Setting standards</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org287389e">
<p>
It's important to understand that before corrective action can be taken some
standards need to be set and agreed upon.  The most important (in this
particular case) being overhead.  How much overhead is the company comfortable
with?  I've experienced anywhere from 10-40% depending on the situation.  In
general I will shoot for 20%.  That equates to 8 hours a week.  Many of my old
bosses would complain that this is too high.
</p>

<p>
If you assume that the average engineer spends 1 hour a day managing e-mail, 
chat, commenting on issues, etc&#x2026; that leaves 3 hours for meetings.  In
actuality 20% overhead is pretty hard to hit so if you are near it you are doing great!
